* @title Ownable
* @dev The Ownable contract has an owner address, and provides basic authorization control
* functions, this simplifies the implementation of "user permissions".
*
* Ownable 컨트랙트는 다음과 같은 역할을 한다.
* 1. 컨트랙트가 생성되면 컨트랙트의 생성자가 전역 변수 Owner에 msg.sender(컨트랙트를 배포한 사람)를 대입한다.
* 2. 특정한 함수들에 대해서 오직 소유자(Owner)만 접근할 수 있도록 제한 가능한 onlyOwner 제어자를 추가한다.
* 3. 새로운 소유자(New Owner)에게 해당 컨트랙트의 소유권을 옮길 수 있도록 한다.
